 * app.get is the method by which we’re adding routes. In the Express documentation,
you will see app.METHOD. This doesn’t mean that there’s literally a method called
METHOD; it’s just a placeholder for your (lowercased) HTTP verbs (get and post being
the most common). This method takes two parameters: a path and a function.

The path is what defines the route

it doesn’t care about the case or trailing slash, and it doesn’t consider
the querystring when performing the match
