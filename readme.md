    * It can get tedious to constantly be rerunning your tests every time
you make a change to your code. Fortunately, most test frameworks
have a “watch” mode that constantly monitors your code and tests
for changes and reruns them automatically. To run your tests in
watch mode, type npm 'test -- --watch' (the extra double-dash is
necessary to let npm know to pass the --watch argument to Jest).

    * Jest helpfully provides some automated code coverage analysis. To see how much of your code is tested, run the following: 'npm test -- --coverage'
* integration testing
