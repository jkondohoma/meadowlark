* Unit testing: test specific functions 
    * It can get tedious to constantly be rerunning your tests every time you make a change to your code. Fortunately, most test frameworks  have a “watch” mode that constantly monitors your code and tests  for changes and reruns them automatically. To run your tests in  watch mode, type 'npm test -- --watch' (the extra double-dash is necessary to let npm know to pass the --watch argument to Jest).

      * Jest helpfully provides some automated code coverage analysis. 
      * To see how much of your code is tested, run the following: 'npm test -- --coverage'
